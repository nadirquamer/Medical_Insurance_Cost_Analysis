# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

### Overview of the dataset

The medical insurance dataset contains information about a number of factors that can affect medical expenses, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. This is a filtered and modified version of the [Medical Insurance Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/medical-insurance-price-prediction?resource=download) dataset, available on the Kaggle website.

### Objectives

In this project, you will:
- Load the data as a pandas dataframe
- Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
- Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
- Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
- Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.

### Setup

For this project, we will be using the following libraries:
- `pandas` for managing the data.
- `numpy` for mathematical operations.
- `sklearn` for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- `seaborn` for visualizing the data.
- `matplotlib` for additional plotting tools.
